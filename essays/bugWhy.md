Sooooo…check out what I found in my house for two days in a row! Like oh my gosh, why?! Scary! Get outta my house! OUT!

Anywho—getting back to programming, I think Javascript is pretty cool. Random I know. It’s actually very similar to C (which I feel I should be more than familiar with) and Java. I am a “newbie” to Javascript but after going through the 106 or so tutorials on FreeCodingCamp.com I feel pretty okay about it. I’ll more than likely need to review a few tutorials to reinforce some of the unfamiliar material that I’ve learned. 

From a software engineering perspective I think Javascript is a useful language to know. The C programming language can be difficult to master considering the pointers and all. But if Javascript doesn’t involve pointers (which I have yet to encounter if they exist in this language) then I think it’s a good language to learn for beginning programmers. 

For ICS 314 course, I find the “athletic software engineering” aspect of the course to be invaluable. The instructor expressed that he wanted us to get our “nerves” out now with these programming quizzes—or WODs—than have us struggle with them through an actual software engineering interview and I appreciate that. Personally, I’d rather suffer the consequences of a bad grade on a quiz than bomb the interview OF MY LIFE—just saying. 

In all honesty, I bombed the first WOD—pathetically. And I just need to get back into the rhythm of studying and practicing. I had a lot of bugs or rather syntax errors. Rest assured, I’ll do better next time. 😉
