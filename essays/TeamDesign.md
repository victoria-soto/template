## Know the Feeling of Having Everything in a Project Figured Out Before You get Started? Neither do I.

I've been on many collaborative teams and strategizing or developing an overall design for a project is probably one of the most difficult aspects of the project. Not only does the skeleton of the project need to be created, but you must also consider possible problems that you might stumble across along the way and how to resolve them. Luckily, there are a number of established software engineering <a href="https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns">design patterns</a> you may choose from to aid you and your team in developing project guidelines that best fits your projectâ€™s needs.

## The Three Software Engineering Design Pattern

There are three main software engineering design patterns you can choose from:
1.	Creational
2.	Structural
3.	Behavioral

### Creational design patterns
The <a href="https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/creational_patterns">creation design pattern</a>focuses on class instantiation or the creation of objects of the class type. This design method aims to reduce any unwanted design complexity by properly controlling the objects created.

## Team Web Application development
For the Spring semester of 2018 my team members: [Brian Hoole](https://brianhoole.github.io), [Chaster Mateo](https://haychaster.github.io), [Yubi Peterson](https://notyubi.github.io) and myself, [Victoria Soto](https://victoria-soto.github.io)were tasked with developing an application that assists users at UH Manoa in locating various food options available to them on campus.
