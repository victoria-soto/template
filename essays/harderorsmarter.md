## Which to Choose?
There are different types of frameworks you can choose from when building a website: Bootstrap, Semantic-UI and UIkit--just to name a few. But which is right for you? To be fair, I’ve only had experience with Semantic-UI; however, upon some initial research, I stumbled across a quote from an <a href="http://opntec.org/choosing-semantic-ui-over-bootstrap-for-the-open-event-front-end/">article </a> comparing Semantic-UI and Bootstrap: 

>In English, it’s much easier to say "There are three tall men" than "There is a tall man, a tall man, and a tall man". This means that in Bootstrap, to achieve a thing (say a navbar), we need to have 2-3 nested classes of “navbar”, ”navbar-default”, etc. whereas with Semantic UI, it can be done with single one.  
<div style="text-align:right">-Open Tech</div>

So which is it? Would you rather construct websites the easy way? Or the *hard* way?

## Pick Your Poision!  
Let's examine the following frameworks: Semantic-UI, Bootstrap, and UIkit--take a look at example code and websites these frameworks can develop from <a href="https://dashbouquet.com/blog/web-development/top-5-most-popular-css-frameworks-that-you-should-pay-attention-to-in-2017#contacts">dashBoquet</a> who reviewed the top five CSS frameworks of 2017.

## I Choose you! Semantic-UI!  
As a beginner software engineer I found Semantic-UI to be very user friendly—it made jumping into website development less *scary*.
