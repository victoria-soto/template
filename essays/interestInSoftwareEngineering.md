Prompt: Create a technical essay (approximately 3-4 paragraphs) that discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future.

I originally started off majoring in bioengineering with the intent of applying to and attending medical school.  The “bio” aspect of my major wasn’t something I was too thrilled about—but the engineering side of it (specifically the engineering projects) is what kept me sane! I worked on a couple of multidisciplinary engineering teams and the engineers that intrigued me the most were the electrical and software engineers. The stuff they worked on always seemed so complicated, foreign, and yet exciting to me. 

I get bored pretty easily and when I’m good at something, I get bored. However, when I struggle with a task I get frustrated and it makes me want to work on it even more until I can figure it out!

Coding was something I can truthfully say didn’t come easy for me. Still, I always thought it was cool how programs can develop into complicated video games or maybe be written to simply make an LED blink. Even though electrical and software engineering freaked me out, I wanted to give it a shot and decided to take digital logic as an elective. After making it through that course my mind was set.

So now I’m a computer engineering student with the goal of getting into software development and eventually create and launch my own Android and iOS applications.
