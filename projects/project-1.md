For the ICS 212 Programming Structure course at UH Manoa, I developed a bank database application in C during the first half of the class and rewrote it in the C++ object oriented programming style. The bank account database had a UI that allowed its users to create a new, delete, modify, print all, or print specific bank account information. Linked lists data structures were used so that adding and deleting accounts could be done easily. The C and C++ bank account database programs were completed independently.

From this experience I learned how to write programs using linked lists, strengthened my ability to work with pointers, and improved upon my debugging and programming skills.
