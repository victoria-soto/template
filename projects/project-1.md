For the ICS 212 Programming Structure course at UH Manoa, I developed a bank database application in C during the first half of the class.

# Here is some code that illustrates how we read values from the line sensors:

# ```js
# byte ADCRead(byte ch)
# {
#    word value;
#    ADC1SC1 = ch;
#    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
#    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
#    }
#    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
# }
# ```
