summary: I designed the hardware and software for growing a tomato plant. The user will be notified via an android application when the sensors detect whether the plant needs water or light.

This project modeled the Tamagotchi digital pet where users could interact and care for their own virtual pet. An Arduino Uno equipped with a photoresistor, temperature sensor, piezoelectric buzzer, and HC-06 Bluetooth module to monitor the status of a tomato plant. If the temperature or light exposure did not meet the plant’s needs, a piezoelectric buzzer would beep, a red LED would continuously blink, and an android application would voice the plants needs to the user. This project is still a work in progress, however, I’ve included the hardware schematic, parts of the android application and Arduino source codes in the link below.
